    <h1>A Shred of Truth in the Sniper Button Myth</h1>

    <p>        Anyone who has gotten their toes wet in post 9/11 military history has heard the rumor of the “sniper button.” The story originates from Ed Nash’s autobiographical account Desert Sniper: How One Ordinary Brit Went to War Against ISIS, in which Nash was unable to convince fighters of the People’s Defense Unit (YPG) that the forward assist on the M16 was not a button that made the bullet shoot harder and more accurately. Now, I am not here to say that Nash was incorrect in trying to convince them otherwise, but the “sniper button” technique might have been created for good reason. </p>
	<p>        I don’t have a lot in common with any irregular force, the YPG included. I buy ammo from Bi-Mart when it goes on sale. Acquiring optics is as easy as a couple hours of research and an online purchase. The most dangerous thing I do is drive to work in a town full of elderly California transplants. That being said, the one thing I do have in common with the YPG is working with secondhand firearms on a regular basis. Troubleshooting one AR15/M16 might be a walk in a park, but imagine the logistics nightmare of thousands of them, many of which might not only be second-hand, but rather third- or fourth-hand, especially if capturing them from their ISIL adversaries. Your armorers may know what to look for, but it does take a while to check every single M16 for all its teeth, its barrel, its gas block, its sights, etc. I doubt it leaves much time to check the small things like a bolt catch or worn gas rings.</p>
	<p>        Gas rings, which, on an M16 and most AR15s, are composed of 3 tiny little rings — imagine them the fraction of the size of the weakest key ring you’ve ever seen. And despite their size, they can cause undergassing, which in the worst case can cause out of battery shots. Fortunately, the Army added a temporary fix for this issue 60 years ago, our wonderful forward assist, in this case known as the sniper button. Hypothetically speaking, a militiaman picks up his well shot M16 and smacks the forward assist after firing a few rounds to find the accuracy and velocity improves and takes it up with his commanding officer. Or perhaps they simply don’t have the ability to have thousands of gas rings sent to them and replaced, so the sniper button technique is deployed as a “just in case” or a morale booster.</p>
	<p>        All in all, the next time you hear a story about something an irregular thing an irregular force does, I hope you have a more nuanced takeaway than “oh those silly insurgents with their silly little ideas.” Don’t walk a kilometer in their shoes, shoot half a kilometer with their guns.</p>
