    <h1>USFS Fire Lookout Tier List</h1>

    <p>I have never listened to the Huck Tuah podcast, and I don’t think I ever will. That being said, there is nothing more fun than imagining what sort of insights the members and guests of the Huck Tuah have to say about our world, telling your friends about it, and then getting them to actually listen to the podcast. Recently, I imagined an episode of them talking about the history of US Forest Service firefighting and making a tier list of all of the major USFS fire lookout models. With drones and Biden’s wildfire detecting satellites, fire lookouts are mostly a thing of the past, with only about 300 still staffed as of 2019, yet they are an important piece of firefighting and environmental history.</p>

    <p>Before going through the tier list, there is some needed context that (I imagined) the Huck Tuers talked about. First is that I am only talking about the common model kits that the USFS built, I will not be including any international models, as cool as the Dave Evans Bicentennial Eucalyptus is, I will not be including it because it violates both of these rules being that it is international and growing a 200 year old tree is not conducive to an easily built kit. The second thing to keep in mind is the two different doctrines that the USFS followed when building these lookouts. Originally, fire lookouts were just a post that an observer would travel to or live near, but then go up to the tower to actively observe. In the 1920s, the “live-in” or “man-wife” lookout was created, in which the lookout would also be the shelter that they lived in during the season. While there were no amenities such as a kitchen or bathroom, the larger floor plan of the “live-in” style allows for a small bed and insulation from that high altitude chill. Live-in models were a lot more popular West of the Mississippi, due to the higher mountains and sparser population densities. On the other hand, the Eastern and Southern United States primarily use “drive-to” styles, which the reduced remoteness was made up for by tower height, allowing observers to see farther over trees and geologic features.</p>

                <td>L4, MC39</td>
                <td>The L4's simple design allows them to be built easily on the tops of mountains, hence why they are the most common model in the Pacific Northwest. It was also large enough to accommodate what the USFS called a "man-wife" lookout, after all, two pairs of eyes are better than 1. It is also built with a winterization roof that folds down, protecting the windows in the offseason. The MC39, on the other hand, was not very large nor is a live-in, however they were able to be put on towers up to 176 feet tall, making it the tallest fire lookout in the world for most of its life, and still the tallest fire lookout in the United States to this day. The height these were built at makes up for the fact that they needed to be built close enough to a place where watchers could access a living structure. The one flaw of the MC39 being a full metal build is made up for by the fact that it is hurricane proof, very important as many of these were built in the Southeast.</td>

                <td>LS40/LX25</td>
                <td>These are both the same but the LS40 has stairs and the LX25 has ladders and landings. The landings on the LX25 are designed in such a way that you are not going to fall too far or get anxious if you do slip, so I think the difference between these two is marginal.</td>

                <td style="background-color: green;">C</td>
                <td>L5, LL25 upgraded, R6</td>
                <td>The L5 is nearly identical to the L4, except about 4 cubic feet smaller and not a live-in structure, preventing it from being placed in the most remote of places and therefore not being able to spot fires as easily. I would put this higher if I had evidence that the smaller size allowed for a taller tower, but there isn't. The LL25 is the LS40's predecessor and is upgraded to have a stairway built in the middle of the scaffolding. The R6 has the largest footprint out of all these structures on this list (towers not included) at 15x15 feet. This allows for a comfortable spacious lookout, however their size made them harder to build and prevented them from being placed on towers. Additionally, they don't have the fold down winterization roof that the L4 and 5 have, making winterizing more of a chore.</td>

                <td style="background-color: blue;">D</td>
                <td>CL100, LL25</td>
                <td>The CL100 is similar to the L4 but does not have the folding winterization roof and is made completely of metal. Very popular in Arizona and California which seems lousy to live in during peak fire season considering the entire metal build. The LL25 was originally built with a huge ladder, no landings up until the very end of the climb. That looks very unfun and rather dangerous to do, which is why they upgraded them. If I got employed as a lookout observer and was assigned to a LL25, I would quit my job on the spot. It's best for those whose hands won't get slippery and clammy in the Southern summer heat.</td>

                <td>D6</td>
                <td>Two-story fire outlook is just bafflingly stupid. It is too large to put up on a tower so it lacks versatility while also being harder to build than other models. In the Pacific Northwest, most fell into disrepair and were replaced by the easy-to-build and spacious L4. The lookout itself was around 3x3 feet; I don't even think you can properly operate your handy dandy Osborne firefinder as the most up-to-date model at the time had a diameter of 2 feet. While I am putting this in F tier, I do not hate it as a structure. It is the oldest live-in lookout ever designed and also has a lot of charm, but makes for a better summer home than a lookout.</td>
