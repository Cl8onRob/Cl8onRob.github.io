        <p>Recently on Twitter, I came across a Bar Rescue clip in which John Taffer enters a walk-in and sees a few mushrooms growing out of cracks in the wall and, understandably, is thrown into a fit of rage. This may be old news, however I saw a handful of people ask what type of mushroom it was. Even on Reddit, people were stumped, and only one person identified it correctly as a Pleurotus ostreatus, also known as an oyster mushroom. This may come as a shock to some people, as most oyster mushrooms donâ€™t look like this as most cases have a convex to plane cap. I will also see them a lot with a more funnel shape, but never in the wild have I seen it develop a club or clover shape.</p>
