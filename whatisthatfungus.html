    <h1>Bar Rescue Mystery Mushroom</h1>

    <p>Recently on Twitter, I came across a Bar Rescue clip in which John Taffer enters a walk-in and sees a few mushrooms growing out of cracks in the wall and, understandably, is thrown into a fit of rage. This may be old news, however I saw a handful of people ask what type of mushroom it was. Even on Reddit, people were stumped, and only one person identified it correctly as a Pleurotus ostreatus, also known as an oyster mushroom. This may come as a shock to some people, as most oyster mushrooms donâ€™t look like this as most cases have a convex to plane cap. I will also see them a lot with a more funnel shape, but never in the wild have I seen it develop a club or clover shape.</p>

    <p>That being said, I have seen it grow in captivity like this. A year ago I tried to see how small I could grow a Pleurotus ostreatus colony while still allowing it to yield mushrooms. I 3D printed a box about 8x8x17 centimeters fitted with the necessary holes for the mushrooms to breathe, manage moisture, and grow. Unfortunately, even though I watered and used a bag to retain moisture, the amount of holes compared to the small amount of substrate led to a low humidity environment, and this is what I suspect causes this strange clubbing effect on the oyster mushrooms.</p>

    <p>I also suspect that this clubbing effect only happens
